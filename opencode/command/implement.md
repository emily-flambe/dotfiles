Implement $ARGUMENTS with intelligent development support.

## Implementation Approach
1. Analyze requirements and detect technology context
2. Review existing codebase patterns and conventions
3. Generate implementation code following best practices
4. Include proper error handling and validation
5. Apply security best practices
6. Add appropriate tests if requested

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow existing project conventions and patterns
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Include input validation and sanitization
- Apply SOLID principles and clean code practices
- Ensure proper typing (TypeScript) or documentation
- Consider performance implications

## Security Considerations
- Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication/authorization where needed
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Use secure communication protocols

## Testing Approach
When tests are requested:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Edge case coverage
- Error scenario testing

Provide clear next steps and integration instructions.
