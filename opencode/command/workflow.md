Design and implement workflow for $ARGUMENTS.

## Workflow Analysis
1. Understand business requirements
2. Map current and desired states
3. Identify process steps and actors
4. Define decision points and branches
5. Plan implementation approach

## Workflow Components
- **Triggers**: What initiates the workflow
- **Steps**: Individual process activities
- **Decisions**: Conditional branching logic
- **Actions**: Operations performed
- **Outputs**: Results and side effects

## Implementation Strategy
- Choose appropriate workflow pattern
- Design state management approach
- Implement error handling and recovery
- Add logging and monitoring
- Create testing scenarios

## Workflow Patterns
Apply appropriate patterns:
- Sequential processing
- Parallel execution
- Event-driven flows
- State machines
- Saga pattern for transactions

## Quality Measures
- Idempotency for reliability
- Compensation for failures
- Audit trail for compliance
- Performance monitoring
- Scalability considerations

## Documentation
- Process flow diagrams
- State transition tables
- API specifications
- Integration guides
- Operational runbooks
