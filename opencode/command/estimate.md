Estimate effort and complexity for $ARGUMENTS.

## Estimation Process
1. Analyze scope and requirements
2. Break down into components
3. Assess complexity factors
4. Calculate time estimates
5. Identify risks and dependencies

## Complexity Factors
- Technical complexity
- Integration requirements
- Testing needs
- Documentation scope
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations

## Effort Breakdown
Provide estimates for:
- Development time
- Testing effort
- Documentation needs
- Review cycles
- Deployment tasks

## Risk Assessment
- Technical uncertainties
- Dependency risks
- Resource constraints
- Timeline pressures
- Scope creep potential

## Recommendations
- Suggested approach
- Team composition
- Milestone planning
- Buffer recommendations
- Success metrics
