Design architecture and structure for $ARGUMENTS.

## Design Process
1. Analyze requirements and constraints
2. Propose system architecture
3. Define component boundaries
4. Plan data flow and state management
5. Consider scalability and performance

## Architecture Principles
- Separation of concerns
- Loose coupling, high cohesion
- Single responsibility principle
- Dependency inversion
- Interface segregation

## Design Deliverables
- High-level architecture diagram
- Component interaction patterns
- Data flow documentation
- API contract definitions
- Technology stack recommendations

## Considerations
- Performance requirements
- Security boundaries
- Scalability needs
- Maintenance overhead
- Team expertise

## Implementation Roadmap
- Break down into phases
- Identify dependencies
- Define milestones
- Estimate effort
- Risk assessment
