Explain how $ARGUMENTS works with clear, detailed analysis.

## Explanation Approach
1. Analyze code structure and flow
2. Identify key components and their roles
3. Trace data flow and transformations
4. Explain business logic and algorithms
5. Highlight important patterns and decisions

## Explanation Levels
- **High-level Overview**: System architecture and purpose
- **Component Details**: Individual module responsibilities
- **Code Walkthrough**: Line-by-line explanations where needed
- **Integration Points**: How components interact
- **Edge Cases**: Special handling and exceptions

## Technical Context
- Technology stack and frameworks used
- Design patterns implemented
- Performance optimizations applied
- Security measures in place
- External dependencies and APIs

## Visual Aids
When helpful, include:
- Flow diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- State machines
- Data structure visualizations
- Architecture diagrams
